In this project we keep working with images but in this case the goal is to define what kind of cloth the program identify in the picture. To do that I used the surpervised method Knn. I'll only use 8 types of clothes.


####This project has been related with university and has been graded with an excellent mark. The tests made by university are not currently in the repository.

#####In the repository there is the Knn algorithm that I used to solve the problem and utils.py ( functions that I may have used while coding the algorithm )
